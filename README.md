We are going to look into relationships between type 1 diabetes and different chareterstics such as height, weight, family history etc. 

## Analytical framework

We use R (mostly tidyverse) to do the entire data analysis. Furthermore, the entire project is reproducible by executing the 00_doit.R file in the folder named R. 

A shiny app was also created that allows the user to enter different values regarding his' or her's condition and then get a prediction of whether or he or she has type 1 diabetes.
