```

## Introduction
- Data set of Rural People from Bangladesh with or without T1-Diabetes 
(source: https://www.kaggle.com/sabbir1996/dataset-of-diabetes-type1)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%' }
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/data/_raw/rawdata.png")
```
- Contains 306 data points and 22 variables
- Classify people with T1 diabetes and explore important variables for T1 diabetes

## Materials and Methods
- Obtain data set 

- Data Wrangling

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analysis and PCA Modeling

- Logistic Regression model and Machine Learning

- Shiny App

- Working collaboratively using RStudio Cloud and Github

## Materials and Methods
- Include flow chart diagram

## Results: Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/Scatter1.png")
```

## Results: EDA (contd.)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_ExplorativeAnalysis_Histogram.png")
```

## Results: EDA (contd.)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '110%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/ScatterPatch.png")
```




## Results: EDA (contd.)
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/06_ExplorativeAnalysis_Density.png")
```


## Results: Analysis and Modeling
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/05_PCA_varExplained.png")
```

## Results: Analysis and Modeling
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Data is well seperated so classification seems to be feasible.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/05_PCA_scatter.png")
```

## Results: Analysis and Modeling
- Logistic regression done using tidymodels

- Perform binary classification

- Parameters: other_diseases, height, weight, famHist2DBin, famHist1DBin

- Assessing the predictive ability of the model

```{r}

```

## Results: Analysis and Modeling
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/07_densityPredictions.png")
```

## Results: Analysis and Modeling
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%'}

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/results/shiny.png")

## Discussion

- Limited by the data set: location, race and habitat of source data limit the global usability of the model

- Unique observation: Family history of diabetes does not impact the likelihood of diabetes

- The accuracy of our model can be increased with added parameters and data points

- Scope for cross platforming and integrated studies 

## Conclusion

- It was feasible to do data analysis and obtain biological insights about our data set

- We conclude that height and weight are important indicators of T1 diabetes 

- We expected family history to be more important

- More descriptive data would have made it easier to conclude and test hypotheses
